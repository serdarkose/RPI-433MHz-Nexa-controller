# RPI 433 MHz Nexa Controller
This is a sunday evening project dedicated to solve my problem not being able to use the codebases on the Internet to control Nexa power switch and the controller.

There are tons of projects, but they seem to be copy of each other and none worked. 

I will be taking [RF-switch](https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch/tree/c5645170be8cb3044f4a8ca8565bfd2d221ba182) project as base and modifying it extensively. The reason I don't update is that it requires a significant changes and keeping it backward compatible is much effort and I don't have time to do it. In case you'd like to do it, feel free to use this code and adapt it to the main project.
